# atom-monokai-light theme

Small fixes for kevinsawicki's Monokai theme for atom with the following:

* text is a bit darker for better contrast
* tags begin and end with the tag name color
* quotes on strings use the quote color
* text selection color is darker than the bg color
* gutter selected color is the bg color for simplicity
* less "bold" for readability
* and more!
