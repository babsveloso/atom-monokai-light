# atom-monokai-light theme

A few changes to kevinsawicki's Monokai theme for Atom to improve contrast and readability.

Changes include:
* "white" text a bit darker for better contrast
* tags begin and end with the tag name color
* quotes on strings use the quote color
* text selection color is darker than the bg color
* gutter selected color is the background color for UI simplicity
* less "bold" to improve readability
* and other small stuff
